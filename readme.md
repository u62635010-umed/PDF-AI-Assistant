The PDF AI Assistant is a Python-based chat application that allows users to communicate with multiple PDF documents simultaneously. By typing queries in everyday English, users can receive precise and meaningful answers extracted directly from the uploaded files. The system leverages advanced language models along with vector-based similarity search to identify and summarize the most relevant information. All responses are strictly derived from the provided PDFs, ensuring that no external data is used.
